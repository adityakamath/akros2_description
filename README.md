# akros2_description
Package with AKROS2 description files

* Publishes the AKROS2 description using [robot_state_publisher](https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher) and publishes the joint states using [joint_state_publisher](https://github.com/ros/joint_state_publisher). 
* The ```joint_state_publisher``` subscribes to [JointState messages](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/sensor_msgs/msg/JointState.html) for each defined joint in the launch file. It then publishes a combined JointState message, which the ```robot_state_publisher``` subscribes to and updates the transforms.
* The launch file also includes an argument ```micro_ros``` which when true will disable the ```joint_state_publisher``` node. Instead, the combined JointState message is published by the micro-ROS node using either the measured or required velocities (based on another launch argument ```joint_state_topic```) of each joint (motor).
* Implements the ```mesh_publisher``` node which publishes the meshes of the URDF elements as a [visualization_msgs/msg/MarkerArray](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/visualization_msgs/msg/MarkerArray.html) message, for remote visualization using tools like [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/studio). The node also publishes the initial JointState message, so that the joints can be visualized even if the micro-ROS node is not initialized or working.
